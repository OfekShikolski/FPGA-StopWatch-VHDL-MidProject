# ⏱️ FPGA-StopWatch-VHDL-MidProject

Mid-course project for the "Programmable Logic Devices" course

This project implements a modular digital stopwatch entirely in VHDL, designed for deployment on an Intel Cyclone V FPGA development board.

### 🔧 Features
- Synchronous stopwatch system with Start, Stop, Lap, and Clear functionality
- FSM-based controller
- BCD counters and 7-segment decoder
- 10ms clock pulse generator
- Fully modular architecture for testing and reuse

### 🧪 Verification
- Simulated in ModelSim
- Synthesized and tested on real hardware (Cyclone V)
- Includes RTL analysis, timing report, and pin assignments

### 📁 Contents
- Source VHDL files (`src/`)
- Testbenches (`tb/`)
- Quartus project files and constraints (`quartus_project/`)
- Project report (`docs/`)
